Challenge
Task is to develop a simple app that handles order placement. It should be implemented as a headless web api that exposes following endpoints:

Place an order for a DNA testing kit providing desired amount of kits, customer id and expected delivery date
List all customer orders
Discount rules:

DNA testing kit base price is 98.99 EUR
Starting from 10 item order there is 5% discount
From 50 item order there is 15% discount
Reject order placement when:

Delivery date is not in future
Desired amount is not positive round number
Desired amount is greater than 999
You can skip authentication and authorization.

Technical requirements
Use c# programming language
Use any testing framework for tests
You can choose whatever tools and libraries you prefer
What gets evaluated
Accordance to business requirements described above
Code quality (we value design guided by tests)
Checkout-and-run convenience
Have fun!
